# 2. Definition

In English, superlative and comparative forms are ways of modifying adjectives to make comparisons between things, people, or ideas.

# 3. Comparative

The *comparative* is used when we want to compare two things or people to indicate that one has a characteristic in greater or lesser degree than the other. The purpose is to show that one thing is **more** or **less** of something compared to another.

## 3.1. **How to Form the Comparative?**

- **Short adjectives (one syllable)**: Add \"-er\" to the end of the adjective.
    - *small* → *smaller* (smaller)
    - *fast* → *faster* (faster)
- **Two-syllable adjectives ending in \"y\"**: Replace \"y\" with \"i\" and add \"-er\".
    - *happy* → *happier* (happier)
    - *easy* → *easier* (easier)
- **Long adjectives (two or more syllables)**: Use \"more\" or \"less\" before the adjective.
    - *interesting* → *more interesting* (more interesting)
    - *expensive* → *more expensive* (more expensive)

## 3.2. **Examples of Sentences with Comparative**

- *John is taller than Peter.* (John is taller than Peter.)
- *This book is more interesting than the other.* (This book is more interesting than the other.)
- *Her car is faster than mine.* (Her car is faster than mine.)

# 4. Superlative

The *superlative* is used to express that one thing or person is the **most** of all in a group of three or more. It emphasizes the highest degree of a characteristic.

## 4.1. **How to Form the Superlative?**

- **Short adjectives (one syllable)**: Add \"-est\" to the end of the adjective.
    - *small* → *smallest* (the smallest)
    - *fast* → *fastest* (the fastest)
- **Long adjectives (two or more syllables)**: Use \"most\" or \"least\" before the adjective.
    - *interesting* → *most interesting* (the most interesting)
    - *expensive* → *most expensive* (the most expensive)
  
## 4.2. **Examples of Sentences with Superlative:**
- *Mary is the tallest girl in the class.* (Mary is the tallest girl in the class.)
- *This is the most beautiful painting I’ve ever seen.* (This is the most beautiful painting I’ve ever seen.)
- *He bought the cheapest phone in the store.* (He bought the cheapest phone in the store.)

# 5. **Important Notes for Comparative/Superlative:**
These rules apply to both comparative and superlative forms.

- **When the adjective ends in \"e\"**: Add \"-r\" for the comparative and \"-st\" for the superlative.
    - Example for *comparative*: *large* → *larger*
    - Example for *superlative*: *large* → *largest*
- **For short adjectives ending in consonant-vowel-consonant**: Double the final consonant before adding \"-er\" for the comparative and \"-est\" for the superlative.
    - Example for *comparative*: *big* → *bigger*
    - Example for *superlative*: *big* → *biggest*
- **For adjectives ending in “y”**: Replace \"y\" with \"i\" and add \"-er\" for the comparative and \"-est\" for the superlative.
    - Example for *comparative*: *happy* → *happier*
    - Example for *superlative*: *happy* → *happiest*
- **For irregular adjectives**: Irregular adjectives do not follow the usual rules and have their own comparative and superlative forms.
    - Example for *comparative*: *good* → *better*
    - Example for *superlative*: *good* → *best*
